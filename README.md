# BudAl

A simple budget allocating system using the [Circle](https://developers.circle.com/) API to abstract Web3 complexity.

## Architecture

BudAl is composed of 3 custom parts that work together:
- The WebApp: a simple React frontend to manage budget allocation.
- The Backend: an Express TypeScript application to handle the logic.
- The Smart Contract: an ERC 20 contract to store allocation on chain.

> üí° We also use [Circle API](https://developers.circle.com/) to handle Web3 for us and the [Nouns DAO](https://nouns.wtf/) for cool assets.

## Motivations

Most standard banking systems such as [Qonto](https://qonto.com/en/payment-methods/card/virtual-card) include systems to create digital cards with pre-defined allocated budgets.

This is super useful to control the company's cash flow and set precise rules around spending.

BudAl is a Web3 implementation of this system, giving a seamless experience to allocate cryptocurrency for
buying goods and services.
Using a simple UI, you can create groups with specific budget allocation, rules of spending and limits.

Combining with Circle API gives a simple abstraction around wallets so you can perform secure and verified actions on the blockchain in few clicks.

BudAl is an accessible solution to democratize cryptocurrency usage around businesses.
